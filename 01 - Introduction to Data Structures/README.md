A short activity:
You are interviewing for a software developer role and are asked this interview question - provide an answer in less than 200 words. Given a set of 1 million customer profiles that need to be stored and analysed for targeted marketing, discuss a data structure that would offer more efficient insertion, deletion, traversal and searching than a LinkedList. Substantiate your answer.
