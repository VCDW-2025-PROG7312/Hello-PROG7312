### Overloaded Fraction Calculator

You are tasked with creating a Fraction class in C# that represents a mathematical fraction (e.g., 1/2, 3/4). The class should support common arithmetic operations and comparisons through operator overloading.
 
Overload the following operators:
* To support arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, ++, and --.
* To support comparison operations: ==, !=, <, >
