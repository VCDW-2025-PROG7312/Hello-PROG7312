### Influential Hashtables 

You are required to implement a custom hashtable data structure to store, retrieve and remove influencers details. For each influencer, you need to store username (can use it as a key), number of followers, when they began, and their most recent post.
 
You are welcome to consult any resources you find useful including the PROG7312 BOT.
