# StackBrowser

You are tasked with creating a mock browser in C# that allows users to "visit" web pages and use a "Back" button to navigate to previously visited pages. Users should also be able to view their history. To implement this, you will use a custom stack data structure which you implement with methods Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty, and Count.
