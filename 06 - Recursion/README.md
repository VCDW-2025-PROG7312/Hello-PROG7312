# Recursion in C#

You will learn about recursion in C# in these activities...

## Activity 1 (essential)

Solve the Fibonacci sequence: https://medium.com/@gideonscrawley/algorithms-of-creation-20222435be06

* Build your own app that recursively works out the first n-th numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
* Use your app to work out Fibonacci(5), then Fibonacci(10), then Fibonacci(20) - how long does it take?
* Use your app to work out Fibonacci(50), then Fibonacci(100) - how long does it take? How do we fix this?Â Hint: Go ahead and fix it with memoization

This activity is essential toward your understanding of recursion.

## Activity 2 (significant)

Solve the staircase problem: https://medium.com/@reza.shokrzad/ascending-algorithms-different-ways-to-climb-stairs-cf60c4b73543

## Activity 3 (important)
