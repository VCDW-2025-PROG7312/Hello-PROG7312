# 🎯 PROG7312 - Data Structures & Algorithms

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to PROG7312! In this module, you’ll get hands-on with the core data structures and algorithms every competent developer should know. You will build, use, and break every structure we discuss using C#.

### What you can expect:
- Practical coding where we build, analyse, and use the structures to solve real problems.
- Activities and exercises to cement each concept.
- Frequent repo pushes for ongoing learning.
- By the end, you’ll be confident with the data structures and algorithms that get tested at interviews (and that you’ll use in your dev career).


## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a module topic. Inside, you'll find activities and resources that I will add as we go. 📁

## 😎 What's the reason for this module in BCAD?

In your first two and a half year of BCAD, you learnt Java and C#, among other technologies. This module is in place to cover several aspects to elevate your programming prowess. Some things to note:

- ⚡ It is technically less complex but is more complex in that it pushes you to understand code deeply.
- 🎯 We will cover content that you will be asked about in job interviews around code efficiency and algorithsm (Trust me. I've been there 👨‍💻).

## 🏆 How will the module be taught?
- 🎓 We will focus on building you for a career as a software developer. This ensures you rock any assessment. (Again, trust me. I've done this before). After all, within a few months, you will be done with this qualification 🎓
- 💡 Its not difficult to just pass, but I want to build rockstars! This means that you will need to write code, break things, and fix things. It's the only way in which one can learn code! 💻🔥
- 💻 We will only use VS Code for this module.

## 🛠 How does ICE work?
My ICE are simple, submit any four apps we built in class. At some point, I will give you GitHub Classroom links to claim repos which you will push to.  

❌ No submission, empty repo, wrong language, or blank submission = 0.

## 👋 Who am I?  
My name is Ebrahim, but many people call me EB (and that's fine). I am currently the Founder of GAMIFIED and a Lecturer at IIE VC. I don't really like writing about myself, but I am open to questions.
