## Binary Search Trees - Organising Video Game Characters

### Activity 1 - Build a Binary Search Tree
Build an app that organizes video game characters based on their Power and Speed. Your goal is to implement a generic binary search tree (BST) where characters are inserted based on their Power. If two characters have the same Power, they are further sorted by Speed.
You can consult the PROG7312 bot, or any resource of your choice.

### Activity 2 - Build a self-balancing trees 
As a follow up to the above activity, you are required to explore self-balancing strategies that may be adopted when it comes to trees - let's explore AVL and Red-Black Trees
1. How does a AVL Tree maintains balance after inserting or deleting a node?
2. How does a Red-Black Tree handle balancing differently from the AVL Tree?
3. What are the trade-offs between AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees?
4. When would you choose an AVL Tree over a Red-Black Tree (or vice versa)?
5. What is the complexity of inserting and searching in an AVL Tree vs Red-Black Tree vs Binary Search Tree?
